Definition of existence -	

	Your life has existence only concerning other living things,
    even while you're alive you would not exist outside the domain of the living.

I don't believe in god, what you do believe or not is not going to play a major role in our existence, Ibelieve in science and mathematics, I believe in how there is a structure to the universe like the universeis a program that runs on a computer and every event in it is like a mathematical function and all thefunctions together form the program that is the universe.

We question our existence, get frustrated or pent about our lives as a function of our conscience. We developed conscience as an evolutionary trait, also known as the tertiary or the third cortex. The primary or the reptilian cortex, secondary (limbic cortex) are the ones we have in common with the primates and without the tertiary cortex we would be equivalent to chimpanzees. If our conscience makes us question existence and life, leading up to our eventual death that would be a failure in our evolution.

No matter what you believe, you have to accept as an absolute objective fact that evolution is an infallible component of life/existence and there can be no misstep in evolution. Before life can change with evolution, there will be organisms that will not be able to adapt to change and thus not use their evolutionary characteristics.  Therefore consciousness plays an important role in the existing world for the society of human beings now many believe that existentialism is a harmful byproduct of human consciousness. Now, with the complete assurance that the science of evolution makes no mistakes, it is valid to assume that existentialism plays or will play an important role in our ongoing existence.


Considering the things I have written on the subject, I have come to a partial conclusion that questioning existence if you are not a philosopher is of no use.

I know I am not a philosopher, So I believe we should find a purpose or a hobby and keep moving forward.  Otherwise, in the pursuit of truth, you will find the objective truth which is subjective in its intrinsic philosophy.




Continue doing what you like, because that is the only thing that will make you like your existence after which there is death. Death is also an absolute objective fact about biological beings, no matter when and how it happens, you must at least try to accept it as it comes closer.



As we are not so far off from primitive beings that makes it hard for us to accept death as a part of life because animals are unaware of it, and we are in an intermediate state of evolution where our consciousness makes effort for us to accept it while our primitive instincts fight back. Our consciousness and instincts work against one another, which causes us fear and anxiety in the face of death.

Like a logical and rational opinion, we should make every effort to help our side of consciousness win the argument. And not just in the topic of death, to help progress, evolution our goal should be to help develop the conscience containing cortex and suppressing our animal instincts, but only as much as can be done comfortably, and to suggest otherwise would be ridiculous.

I want to stress that I am talking about conscience and not empathy or sympathy.

A final thought on absolute objectivity is that anything that leads to your eventual death should not be exercised, because no matter how good we can explain our existence, it comes down to the simple fact that we are living organisms, and living organisms strive for life irrespective of our conclusions on life  which we believe are the absolute truth and going against that goes against the natural law or the mathematical equation of the universe.
